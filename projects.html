		<h2>Hands-on Environmentalism is what we do!</h2>
		<p>This is what sets the TRAA apart from other clubs and organizations. You'll find us right in the water clearing obstructions from streams, measuring returning salmonids & taking scale samples for DNA analysis, education through trout hatchery tours & stream walks, being a voice for the Thames River watershed & its inhabitants and the list goes on. Below are some of our past projects weâ€™ve been working on go on and take a look!</p>

			<h2>Stream Rehabilitation</h2>
			<p>Here's an overview of what happened over a few weekends in the 
			Spring of 2012 when TRAA members and personnel from the Upper Thames River Conservation Authority (UTRCA) waded in for Year 3 of our 5-year Salmonid Tagging and Monitoring Program. Jon George, an MNR biologist from Thunder Bay who is helping us out with this project.

			We survey the river to find Rainbow Trout so that we can stun the rainbow trout to relocate them down the river. Dan Schinkelshoek and Rob Huber follow closely ready to stunned rainbow trout to relocate them down the river. Oddly enough, many fish this year were found in the faster flows such as this good rifle just upstream from a large culvert. 

			Once the fish are stunned we prepare to revive this female rainbow trout in the lower section of the creek before we could safely conduct the tagging, measuring and sampling procedures. Once the trout is measured, the girth of a solid rainbow trout. The length, the sex and whether or not the fish has already spawned are also recorded in the monitoring log. This information, along with a scale sample are all referenced to the tag number that will be attached to the fish. Then we "sewing" of a small, plastic tag to the dorsal fin of the rainbow trout is actually the trickiest of all the procedures performed. The tag has a number sequence that will help the OMNR (Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources) and the TRAA to understand the fish's activities. 

			Scale samples are taken from every tagged fish for DNA analysis to determine age and genetic classification. While our tags are green, there are lots of different tags on many species of fish out there. It's vital that you report these tag numbers and descriptions to the OMNR whether you keep or release the fish. Otherwise, all this work is compromised. Not every fish netted is a trout and that's a good thing! We found hognose sucker it's native to fast flowing cold water streams and rivers. They're an indicator of good to excellent water quality and yes, there's lots of trout, both rainbows and browns. We love to see the various year classes that indicate a success rate of reproduction. It also points to healthy biomass in the stream to support both resident and lake-run trout. It's always a thrill to have nice healthy browns mixed in with the bruiser steelhead that we target for the monitoring program. Rob safely delivers another rainbow trout back to the stream after she's given up her vital statistics in the name of science!</p>
